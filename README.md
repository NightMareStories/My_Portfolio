# Hello!

## This site - is my portfolio with projects, developments, and just my experience in front-end development. The site and it's content, will be updated as far as possible, time and effort.
&nbsp;

### The application is written in "React JS" using "React-Redux". To test it, you need to:
### **1. `First you need to install `"[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)"` on your computer. To check its presence on your PC, enter the command in the terminal:`**

```
node --version 
```

```
npm --version
```

### `If the commands work and display versions, then "Node" and "NPM" are already installed;`
### **2. `Install all dependencies with the "npm i" command in the terminal:`
&nbsp; 

```
npm i
```
&nbsp;

### **3. `After installing all the necessary modules, you can start the application with the "npm start" command:`
&nbsp;

```
npm start
```
&nbsp;

## **Let's get started!**

# 1. Introduction

### "My Portfolio" is a site with information about me, my projects and my development in web development. It contains blocks with a portfolio of projects and certificates, loading them from the "Redux" repository. Also on the page there are contact details and brief information about me.
&nbsp;

### The work of this site is to display data from the created "Redux" stores on the page in blocks with portfolios and certificates. When you select a project or certificate, a modal window is displayed with detailed information about it received from the repository. You can test any of my projects by clicking on the "Start App" button, or see its code and its description by clicking on the link to "GitHub".
&nbsp;

### In this project, I did not use any third-party sliders, modules and libraries, only "React JS", the "React-Redux" module and the "@reduxjs/toolkit" module for convenient creation of storage slices. The site is optimized and responsive for mobile devices.
