                    "Olimp" is an online store site selling sports equipment and goods focused on healthy leisure. It consists of a main page, a product catalog page, a product page, and a checkout page.

                <p>
                    "JavaScript" was used in the development of this site, and "Gulp" was used as the project builder. The site was visualized using the "SCSS" preprocessor.

                <p>
                    "Cart of Watches" is an application written in "JavaScript" using "LocalStorage" browser and using "Classes" made available in "ES6" edition. This application using "OOP" allows you to add items to the cart, increase, decrease or remove them from the cart, while counting their amount and quantity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works? In the catalog of goods you choose the watch you like, add it to the basket. At the same time, an object with the goods that you added to the cart is created in the user's browser, in the local storage. The cart itself retrieves your items and quantities from the browser's local storage and displays them on the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, by going to the basket, you will see all the products that you have added and you can increase or decrease their quantity or remove them from the basket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the project, I used the "SCSS" preprocessor using the "BEM" CSS-class methodology and the "Gulp" project builder. Also, the project is fully adapted for mobile devices.

                <p>
                    "Notes on ReactJS" is an application written in "ReactJS", "NodeJS" and using the server-side development environment "OpenServer", the application also makes extensive use of routing for SPA, but there are also redirection functions with page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The work of the application is to create notes or messages by the user and view the already created notes or messages for review. Each note when created has its own unique ID-hash, which can be copied and pasted on the search page, thereby familiarizing yourself with its contents.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thanks to the interaction between the "backend" and "frontend" via the API, as well as the application for creating and working with sql tables "PhpMyAdmin" in the server environment "OpenServer" - the Notes on ReactJS application creates and saves notes on the server, and gets the generated notes when requested from the client.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Try it, from the main page you can go directly to creating or viewing notes (you need a note ID to view). After creation, you can follow the link directly to the created note, or by clicking on the field with the note ID to copy it. Now you can go to "NOTES" to paste the copied note by clicking in the search field, if the note is found, then all its contents will be shown, if not, then you made a mistake with the spelling and received an error notification.

                    "Cart of Goods" - is an application written in "ReactJS" and "JavaScriptES6". In this application, it is implemented and divided into components - a "catalog of goods" to be added to the cart and the "cart of goods" added to it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The application logic is as follows, all goods data is in one "object", the "goods catalog" receives goods data from this "object" and render it on the page, each product on the page has a "button" to add this product to the "cart". The "cart" itself saves data on the goods added to it and render them on the page in its block below the catalog. At the bottom of the "cart" there is a calculation of the amount of added items and their quantity. Also in the "cart" it is possible to reduce the quantity of a specific product and completely delete its position.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In order to implement this logic, I used the React modules: "redux", "react-redux" and "reduxjs-toolkit". For the "cart" and the "catalog of goods", their own storages-slices, reducers, containers and components for render on the page were created. To style the application, I used the "SCSS" preprocessor.

                    "My Portfolio" is a site with information about me, my projects and my development in web development. It contains blocks with a portfolio of projects and certificates, loading them from the "Redux" repository. Also on the page there are contact details and brief information about me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The work of this site is to display data from the created "Redux" stores on the page in blocks with portfolios and certificates. When you select a project or certificate, a modal window is displayed with detailed information about it received from the repository. You can test any of my projects by clicking on the "Start App" button, or see its code and its description by clicking on the link to "GitHub".
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, I did not use any third-party sliders, modules and libraries, only "React JS", the "React-Redux" module and the "@reduxjs/toolkit" module for convenient creation of storage slices. The site is optimized and responsive for mobile devices.

                <p>
                    When the page is loaded, the application sends a request to the service for issuing a currency value, receives data on currencies, converts and displays this data on the page. Also, data on currencies is sent to the currency calculator, where the user can calculate the amount of any selected currency in euros.
                </p>

                    "Cabinet on JavaScript" is an application written in "JavaScript ES6" and "Php" that uses the server-side development environment "OpenServer" and the "Materialize" framework to style the application. . It is an opportunity for a user to register in the system or log in and enter his personal account. In his personal account, he can always change his personal data or log out of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This application has a "front-end" and "back-end" part and works through "ajax requests". The operation of the application looks like this: the user enters his data into the form, confirms the entered data, the data is sent to the server in the database, and with further authorization, the user enters his personal account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the personal account for an authorized user, his personal data are loaded from the database and displayed in the appropriate fields. When the user's personal data changes, the updated data is also sent to the server in the database, and when you re-enter your personal account, the new personal data of the user that he changed is loaded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the user can log out from the personal account and then the username and password will have to be entered again. This application actively used "cookies" to interact with the personal account, as well as to update its data.
