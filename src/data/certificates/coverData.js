                    As we all know, frameworks are now a mandatory requirement for almost every IT company. They provide fast, simple and collaborative work in the current IT decade. One of the most popular today is "React JS".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This course includes extended and detailed information on working with "React JS" in real conditions and on real tasks. In this course, I learned in depth the various tools and features of "React JS", such as: "working with JSX"; "creating components"; "routing and creation of SPA and MPA"; "events and functions"; "state and props"; "life cycle of components"; "refs and DOM"; "creating elements in React"; "hooks and working with them"; "redux store, reducers, action"; "redux toolkit"; "React in conjunction with PHP"; "React in conjunction with Node.js".
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the process of studying the course, I completed 123 or more practical tasks on the above topics, consolidating my knowledge and applying it to real projects. It was this course that showed me how frameworks, and in this case "React JS", are convenient and practical in application development, because it was on "React JS" using "redux" and "toolkit" that I created my portfolio site, on which you are now are.

                    The key role of any programming is working with arrays of data and objects. Any large project, any program, any application includes working with arrays and data objects, for example, the same "online store" or "personal account". Understanding the process of interaction of tools for working with arrays and objects is the very foundation that every developer needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this course, I learned the actual techniques for working with arrays and objects in "JavaScript", discovering a wide variety of tools and putting them into practice. This course covers the following topics: searching for values in an array - the "indexOf" method; array methods: "Includes"; array methods "push" and "pop"; methods "Shift", "Unshift", "Slice"; array method "Map"; "Filter" method; methods "Reduce", "isArray"; methods "Splice", "concat"; methods "Find," "FindIndex", "LastIndexOf"; methods "Sort", "Reverse"; methods "Split", "Join"; methods "Every", "Some"; methods "Flat", "Fill", "keys".
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you can see, there are many tools for working with arrays and objects in "JavaScript", but it's worth considering that they all have their own scope, so you should always read the documentation for working with them. During this course, I completed all 120 tasks on these topics, working with each of these methods and honing my skills in working with arrays and objects.

                <p>
                    "OOP" it is a programming methodology based on the interaction of objects with each other, making it possible to inherit some properties and data from one object to another, change these properties, add new ones, etc. Due to this, when creating large projects, it is unnecessary to constantly create new data, write a huge amount of code, thereby making it unoptimized and difficult to read for everyone. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this course, after completing 49 tasks, I met and mastered the work of "OOP" in "JavaScript" using "prototypes", as well as the new "Class" syntax in "JavaScript ES6", and studied the following topics:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What is OOP, myths and reality. OOP Whales : encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance"; "The concept of an object. Properties and methods. Prototype programming. Inheritance"; "Class, object, constructor. properties and methods. This"; "Inheritance using classes. Super, constructor"; "Magic methods get, set (getters and setters). The concept of private properties"; "Static properties and methods"; "This is a value in classes, objects, functions. Arrow functions and this. The concept of context"; "Explicitly specifying a context using call and apply. The bind method".

                    Every year there are more and more programming technologies, new frameworks, libraries and various tools for different projects and purposes appear. They allow you to create fast, optimized and readable interfaces that people from all over the world use. One of the most popular today is "React JS".

                <p>
                    React Lite Level is a short introduction to "React JS", it understands the main features and tools in working with "React JS" using the new "Class" syntax introduced in "JavaScript ES6". The topics of this course were: "Introduction to Node.js and NPM"; "Installing React and generating the first application. Getting to know the structure of the application"; "OOP in ES6. The concept of properties and methods, classes, objects, inheritance. Part 1, Part 2"; "Prototype inheritance in JS"; "The concept of components. Creating components. Calling components in each other"; "Props and State. Part 1, Part 2, Part 3"; "Working with Forms. React. Lite Level"; "Life cycle of components"; "A simple React game"; "React JSX"; "Site navigation in React. React Router"; "Deploy React Apps".

                <p>
                    After completing this course and solving 86 tasks, I learned how "React JS" works and got to know it well. I created several of my projects using the knowledge gained from this course to consolidate and remember all the features of "React JS".

                    JavaScript is a programming language that has been in the lead all over the world for many years. A large number of front-end developers create their projects on it. A voluminous number of frameworks, libraries, extensions and tools have been created for it, but native "JavaScript" is still a very important item to work in any "Web development" company.
